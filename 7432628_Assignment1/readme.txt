Run keyGen1 and keyGen2 to generate the 2 unique pairs of recipient and secret key pairsFor Encryption, edit Line 28 for which recipient key to useFor Decryption, edit Line 29 for which private key to useEnc can be run through the terminal as ./A1Enc.pyDec can be run through the terminal as ./A1Dec.pyEdit Ck.bin version accordingly in the encryption script.Ensure that during decryption, the correct key pair is being used and the ck.bin is correct for the pair otherwise decryption will fail.Do not run keyGen1 or keyGen2 after running the encryption script. the Recepient and Secret key will change and decryption will be impossible.
