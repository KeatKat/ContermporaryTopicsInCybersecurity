Ensure that only 0.json is within the folder and no other .json blocks or the verification of the blocks will be wrong.

open 2 terminals, one for Bob.py and one for Alice.py

i reccomend running alice first because bob finds the first block quite quickly. once the first block is found, the programs will be synced up so no user input is required

expected outcome , please refer to the report.

the blocks are in .json
